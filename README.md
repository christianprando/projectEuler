# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains some of the solutions for Project Euler problems.
For more information about Project Euler, access the website: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

### Requirements
You will need an environment with .NET Core 3.1 or later in order to build this solution.

### How to build
At the root folder, run the following command:

```$```
```dotnet build --configuration Release```

### How to run
After building, navigate to *.\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1* or equivalent build directory.

Run the following command, replacing PROBLEM_NUMBER with the number of the problem number.
You can specify multiple problems by typing a comma-separated list.

```$```
```ProjectEuler.exe -p PROBLEM_NUMBER...```

###### Examples:

```$```
```ProjectEuler.exe -p 63```

```$```
```ProjectEuler.exe -p 63,67,68```

#### Why are you missing some problems?
I started solving Project Euler projects in university and continued sporadically throughout the last several years. Unfortunately it did not occur to me to start a repository until now, and I have no idea where the code for previous problems is. I might go back and redo previous problems at some point.

#### Disclaimer
Most of the solutions are not as tidy, or event as efficient, as they could be. I arrive at the solutions with a "quickest path to answer" strategy.
Once I arrive at the correct solution, I will sometimes spend a bit of time cleaning up, other times I just move on to the next problem.
